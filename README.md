# AI_Homework_Assignment_TSP

## Introduction
This application solves the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using three algorithms: Depth-First Search (DFS), Uniform Cost Search (UCS), and A* Search (A*).

## Problem Statement
Implement and compare three algorithms (DFS, UCS, A*) to solve the TSP. The input is an adjacency matrix of city distances.

## Algorithms Implemented
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
2. **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**
3. **A* Search (A*)**

## Application Overview
### Input Data Format
The input is an adjacency matrix representing distances between cities, read from standard input.

### Output Data Format
The output is the minimum cost of a TSP tour found by the selected algorithm.

## Compiling the Code
To compile the code, use the provided Makefile. Run the following command in the terminal:
```sh
make
./tsp_solver
